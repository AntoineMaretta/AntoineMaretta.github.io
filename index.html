 <p>Argentina was a wonderful experience that taught me a lot about the world around us. I have had the opportunity to travel to different neighbouring countries. I learned from this trip to be open-minded. My favorite moment was the visit to the salt desert because I felt like I was very small in the middle of nothing. </p>
